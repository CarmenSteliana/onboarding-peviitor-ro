My experience as a QC Data Reviewer in the pharmaceutical industry, along with my enthusiasm for technology, fueled my desire to delve deeper into the processes of evaluating and verifying software products and applications. 


The first steps I took in this direction was to take the Introductory Course at the School Informal of IT where I acquired knowledge of CSS, HTML and JavaScript (my personal projects are on my GitHub profile) and then to obtain the ISTQBÂ® Certified Tester Foundation Level certification. 


Currently, I am impatient and excited to join the peviitor.ro project in order to continue to develop and be a good tester day by day.




PS: I have looked at the Google documentary and the final sentence of Ben Gomes who said " our job here in Search is never done" caught my attention.
I consider that Ben Gomes' quote highlights a fundamental truth for both the development of search algorithms and software testing: the need for continuous learning and      adaptation. 
To be a good tester, it is essential to adopt a continuous improvement mindset, stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies, and always be willing to learn and adapt to new challenges. 
This dedication to continuous learning ensures that testers can effectively contribute to the quality and success of the software over time.
